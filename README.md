# Data Science Case Studies

I'm working with Python data science libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, and matplotlib).  I'm putting together a series of case studies, as real-world examples.  First up: Trends in Global Temperature Average.

Case studies are published as Jupyter notebooks.  You can also access the HTML versions here: https://jfcarr.github.io/data_science_case_studies/
